# Fork info
this is a fork of [keybord-heatmap](https://github.com/pa7/Keyboard-Heatmap) made by [Patrick Wied](https://github.com/pa7), but he havent been active since 2017, and i need a danish keyboard heatmap


# Keyboard Heatmap
This repository contains the sourcecode of [pa7's "recently" released keyboard heatmap](http://www.patrick-wied.at/projects/heatmap-keyboard/ "Realtime Keyboard Heatmap").
The keyboard heatmap shows the distribution of characters of a text while you're typing. It's using Pa7's JavaScript heatmap library ([heatmap.js](http://www.patrick-wied.at/static/heatmapjs/ "Heatmap.js")) to make that possible.

Currently support keyboard layouts:
- ASSET
- CARPALX_QFMLWY
- QWERTY
- QWERTY_DK
- DVORAK (Zeff Houssney)
- DVORAK PROGRAMMER
- COLEMAK
- COLEMAK_ISO
- COLEMAK_ISO_DK
- LIIGOL (Liigo Zhuang)
- ERGODOX COLEMAK/DVORAK/QUERY
- MINIMAK 4/8/12 K
- NORMAN
- WORKMAN


**Contributions are very welcome!**
